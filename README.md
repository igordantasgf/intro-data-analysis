# **My introduction to Data Science**
## Case1:

   My first simple case using data analysis with financial data for **Quantitative Finance Club(QFC) - UFBA**
## Old Studies: 
   
   *Some old studies with memory saving, data description and visualization*
   
   Made this when I was learning some basics of Python programming, data reading, etc. I've learned how to get some info of datasets, memory saving and graph plotting (usa_graph:    plotted USA map according with population)
   
   - estudandos_pandas.ipynb: python notebook with code

   - teste.html: Profile Report of kc_house_data.csv dataset
   
   - kc_house_data.csv: some random data i found online
  
   - usa_graph.png: "USA by population" image, plotted with MatPlotLib using data with longitude, latitute and population of USA cities
